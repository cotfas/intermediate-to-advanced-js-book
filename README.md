# More ideas for the book (notes for myself)

- hidden classes
- javascript modules
- performant javascript tips/tricks
- map
- sets
- weakmap and when to actually use them
- regexes and how they work under the hood
- custom errors with error class + `instanceof`
- fun functions such as `debounce`, `throttle`, `memoize`, deep clone etc. look at lodash and underscore for inspiration
- inversion of control
