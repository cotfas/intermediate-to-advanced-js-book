# JavaScript book: Intermediate to Advanced

This is something I originally did as an outline for a course. But I've decided to turn it into a free book.

I'm also accepting PRs for this book, if you wanna contribute and write one of the remaining chapters.

And yes, I want it to include very deep things such as hidden classes (which you really never learn about).

# Outline

1. **Statements vs Expressions**
2. **Data Types and Variables**
3. **Equality and Type Coercion**
4. **Objects**
5. **Arrays**
6. **Functions**
7. **Prototypes and Inheritance**
8. **Loops and Iteration**
9. **Truthy and Falsy Values**
10. **Logical Operators**
11. **Rest and Spread Operators**
12. **JavaScript Runtime Environment**
13. **Intervals and Timeouts**
14. **Promises**
15. **Async/Await**
16. **HTTP methods and codes**
17. **Fetch API**

# More ideas for the book

- hidden classes
- javascript modules
- performant javascript tips/tricks
- map
- sets
- weakmap and when to actually use them
- regexes and how they work under the hood
- custom errors with error class + `instanceof`
- fun functions such as `debounce`, `throttle`, `memoize`, deep clone etc. look at lodash and underscore for inspiration
- inversion of control
