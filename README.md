Outline:

1. **Statements vs Expressions**
2. **Data Types and Variables**
   - Types in JavaScript and checking for a type with `typeof` operator
   - Surprise types: `null`, functions, and arrays being objects under the hood
   - `let` vs `const`: Understanding immutability with `const`, when to use `let`
3. **Equality and Type Coercion**
   - Double vs Triple equals (`==` vs `===`)
   - Type coercion nuances
4. **Primitives vs Objects**
   - How they're stored in memory
   - Why `object === object` is false but `primitive === primitive` is true
   - Copying reference vs making a shallow copy
5. **Objects**
   - Creating an object, destructuring, accessing object values
   - Property value shorthand
   - Object methods such as `.entries` and other useful methods
6. **Arrays**
   - `Array.isArray`
   - Array methods
   - Destructuring arrays
7. **Functions**
   - Function declaration and expression
   - Higher-order functions
   - Returning functions
   - Closures
   - Practical examples of complex functions (e.g., deep cloning an object)
8. **Prototypes and Inheritance**
   - Prototype in JavaScript, `__proto__`
   - Why JavaScript has prototypes
   - How prototypes work and nuances to be aware of
9. **Loops and Iteration**
   - `for...of` loops
   - Using object methods to loop over objects (`.entries`, `.keys`, `.values`)
10. **Truthy and Falsy Values**
11. **Logical Operators**
    - `&&`, `||`
12. **Rest and Spread Operators**
13. **JavaScript Runtime Environment**
    - JavaScript being single-threaded
    - Call stack and memory
    - Web APIs, callback queue, and event loop
14. **Intervals and Timeouts**
    - Ins and outs of `setInterval` and `setTimeout`
    - Tips and tricks, such as implementing your own throttling function
15. **Promises and Async/Await**
    - Explaining what promises are and their states
    - Microtask queue and the event loop
    - Error handling with `try...catch`
    - Patterns and tricks when working with promises
16. **HTTP and Fetch API**
    - HTTP methods explained
    - Fetch API: Understanding responses, `response.json()`, handling errors
    - HTTP status codes
17. **JavaScript Modules**
    - Named and default imports
    - Import syntax using relative paths
    - Renaming imports
