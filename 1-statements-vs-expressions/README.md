# Expressions

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. For example, `2 + 2` is an expression that produces the value `4`. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or as complex as a function call that returns a value.

```javascript
5 + 3; // evaluates to the value 8
"Hello, " + "World!"; // evaluates to the string "Hello, World!"
x[(1, 2, 3)] // evaluates to the value of the variable x
  .pop(); // evaluates to the number 3
```

Expressions can be used as part of a statement, such as assigning the result of an expression to a variable or using an expression as a condition in an if statement

Key characteristics of expressions:

- They produce a value when evaluated.
- They can be used wherever a value is expected, such as in function arguments or assignments.
- They can be combined with other expressions using operators to form more complex expressions.
